In a stonemason of culinary delight,
Where tastes, aromas and flavors ignite,
A symphony of senses takes flight,
Beyond the eve of culinary night,
With succulent meals and drinks under light,
A culinary eve adventured from aught(anything),

A gastronomic journey we'd dream,
Across this culinary vibrant gleam.
Through kitchens and menus, we'll roam,
Unveiling secrets, finding our home,
In this culinary dome,
Where flavors widely roam.

From savory bites to sweet delight,
A culinary journey takes flight,
In this culinary night, I dreamt another night.
In this culinary night, I dreamt another flight.
Another sight, my life with in light.
