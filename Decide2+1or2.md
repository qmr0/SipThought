Decide how you see your growth in a form of number. We can say it several way and prove it,
suppose 1+1=2 then 2+1=3 or 2+2=4 or here it gives virious possibilities.
So thinking differs varies but math give you exponential growth.

For instance if I say that into words it will sounds like this
1. To chart your course of personal growth, establish well-defined goals and pursue them with unwavering zeal.
Employ the SMART framework to ensure that your goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound
2. To delineate your path of personal growth, cultivate a willingness to embrace discomfort and propel yourself beyond the confines of your comfort zone.
Discomfort serves as a beacon, illuminating the path toward newfound knowledge and broadened horizons.
Seek out opportunities for professional and personal growth, such as undertaking novel projects, acquiring new skills, dedicating your time to a worthy cause, or venturing into uncharted territories.
By immersing yourself in diverse perspectives, cultures, and experiences, you will enrich your life and expand your worldview.
3. To maintain motivation and focus on your goals, cultivate a clear purpose and vision for your life. Delve into your innermost being by asking yourself: 
* What ignites your passion? What values guide your actions?
* What are your strengths and weaknesses? What problems do you yearn to solve?
* What opportunities do you wish to seize? What dreams do you aspire to realize?
* By unraveling the answers to these questions, you will gain clarity on the changes you desire to make in your life, ensuring alignment with your core identity.
